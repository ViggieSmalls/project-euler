# Project Euler
First time I read about project euler was on [Medium](https://blog.usejournal.com/consider-yourself-a-developer-you-should-solve-the-project-euler-problems-ed8d13397c9c).
I thought it is a good idea to improve my coding skills.

The problems can be found at [https://projecteuler.net/archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives). 
I had a lot of trouble to find the solutions online, until I found out that if you register, you get an input field where you can type in your solution and check if it is correct.

I also found [this blog](https://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-solutions/) with all the solutions, which is helpful to figure out what can be done better.
